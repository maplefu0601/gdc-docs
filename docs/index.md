# Welcome to GDC Docs

This is a temporary fork of the ICGC docs project to try out mkdocs and see if this could be inter-operable with Drupal.

## Contents

The GDC documentation is divided into the following top-level sections:

* [GDC](gdc/about.md)
* [Data Portal](data-portal/about.md)
* [Submission GUI](submission-gui/01-Using_the_GDC_Data_Submission_Portal_User_Guide.md)
* [Data Transfer Tool](data-transfer-tool/about.md)
* [API](API/01_-_Using_the_GDC_API_User_s_Guide.md)
