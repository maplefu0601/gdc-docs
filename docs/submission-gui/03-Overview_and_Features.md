# Details and Activity Panel

The third panel, on the right-hand side of the page, provides more details about a selected entity in two sub-sections, _'Details'_ and _'Activity'_.

The exact content of those sub-sections depends on the type of entity (e.g. case, sample, transaction) of the selection in the navigation panel.

The Activity section lists all past transactions associated with an entity, clicking on a transaction will redirect the user to this particular transaction.

# Filtering and Searching

The search menu available at the top of the screen is context-sensitive.
