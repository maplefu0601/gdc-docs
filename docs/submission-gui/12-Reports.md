# Scientific Pre-alignment QC Report

This report shows the files in the data bundle on which GDC will perform harmonization as well as QC information on the submitted unaligned BAM/FASTQ files. Each unaligned BAM/FASTQ will link to the QC report.

This report can be downloaded in TSV or JSON from the Read Groups section of the navigation panel.

| Module | Warning Criteria | Failure Criteria | Documentation Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Statistics | Basic Statistics never raises a warning. | Basic Statistics never raises an error. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/1%20Basic%20Statistics.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/1%20Basic%20Statistics.html) |
| Per Base Sequence Quality | A warning will be issued if the lower quartile for any base is less than 10, or if the median for any base is less than 25. | This module will raise a failure if the lower quartile for any base is less than 5 or if the median for any base is less than 20. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/2%20Per%20Base%20Sequence%20Quality.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/2%20Per%20Base%20Sequence%20Quality.html) |
| Per Tile Sequence Quality | This module will issue a warning if any tile shows a mean Phred score more than 2 less than the mean for that base across all tiles. | This module will issue a warning if any tile shows a mean Phred score more than 5 less than the mean for that base across all tiles. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/12%20Per%20Tile%20Sequence%20Quality.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/12%20Per%20Tile%20Sequence%20Quality.html) |
| Per Sequence Quality Score | A warning is raised if the most frequently observed mean quality is below 27 - this equates to a 0.2% error rate. | An error is raised if the most frequently observed mean quality is below 20 - this equates to a 1% error rate. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/3%20Per%20Sequence%20Quality%20Scores.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/3%20Per%20Sequence%20Quality%20Scores.html) |

| Sequence Length Distribution | This module will raise a warning if all sequences are not the same length. | This module will raise an error if any of the sequences have zero length. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/7%20Sequence%20Length%20Distribution.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/7%20Sequence%20Length%20Distribution.html) |
| Sequence Duplication Levels | This module will issue a warning if non-unique sequences make up more than 20% of the total. | This module will issue a error if non-unique sequences make up more than 50% of the total. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/8%20Duplicate%20Sequences.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/8%20Duplicate%20Sequences.html) |
| Overrepresented Sequences | This module will issue a warning if any sequence is found to represent more than 0.1% of the total. | This module will issue an error if any sequence is found to represent more than 1% of the total. | [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/9%20Overrepresented%20Sequences.html](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/9%20Overrepresented%20Sequences.html) |
