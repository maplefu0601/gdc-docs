# About

The GDC API is the external facing REST interface for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The GDC API drives the GDC Data Portal and GDC Data Submission Portal and is made available to external users for programmatic access to the features and capabilities of both GDC Portals.
